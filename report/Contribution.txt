Contribution

Rudrani

- Code output generation for Single-Threaded Code
- Studied paper: Yadav, M. K., & Baria, M. J. Mini-Batch K-Means Clustering Using Map-Reduce in Hadoop
- 50 % code output generation for SSE and Categorization Accuracy Results
- Came up with idea for Categorization Experiment.
- Implemented SSE generation code.
- Implemented function to read and transform the category file.
- Implemented the code for random picking of documents
- Implemented the code for caching the centroids
- Other parts of the code were more or less shared equally between us


Siddharth

- Code output generation for Multi-Threaded Code
- Studied paper:Wan, J., Yu, W., & Xu, X. (2009, December). Design and implement of distributed document clustering based on MapReduce. 
- 50 % code output generation for SSE and Categorization Accuracy Results.
- Came up with idea for SSE Experiment.
- Implemented Categorization Accuracy finder code.
- Implemented function to read and transform the documents file.
- Implemented cosine similarity function
- Implemented the code for updating the centeroids
- Other parts of the code were more or less shared equally between us


We both collaborated on working on:
- Report Writing
- Poster preparation
- Setup of Juliet environment
- Understanding Harp functionalities and using custom Data Structure for exchanging information with Tables
- Understanding which part of the code can be multi-threaded and distributed
